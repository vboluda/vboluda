### I am Vicente Boluda Vias ðŸ‘‹ 
I am a software architect specialized in Web3 and Backend. I am passionate about IT since I programmed since I was a child. I find especially exciting the Web3 world in which I have been involved since 2013. This world moves very fast, and  I love learning new technologies. 

## Backend
I have developed modules at the presentation layer using old Java servlets up to the latest API-oriented microservices approaches. 

## Infrastructure
I know the Unix family systems, starting with Solaris up to the latest Linux distributions, including Ubuntu and Raspbian. I have deployed and maintained physical machines, virtual machines and containers. I have deployed infrastructure on Azure and AWS.

## Web3
Since I discovered this technology at the beginning of 2013, I have been firmly committed to it. I have been a miner, a developer of smart contracts and have deployed infrastructure including several private EVM networks (side chains).

## Frontend
I have worked with multiple technologies and products including those old Java Applets and FLEX/FLASH technology to modern framewors like ReactJS.
